## Tools

### 1. DevContainers for Smart Contract Development

Quickly get started with smart contract development using Docker containers. This setup allows you to run your smart contracts in a consistent environment across different machines. The setup provides both a foundry environment and a Hardhat environment. To use the setup:

a) Clone the repository and open it in vscode/cursor/windsurf/editor of your choice.

```
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/DevEx-DevRel
cd DevEx-DevRel
code .
```

b) Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container". You will have 2 choices to choose from: foundry and hardhat. This will build the container and open the project in the container.
